I’m a passionate robotics and AI researcher with 10 years of industry experiences.  My expertise includes robotics manipulation, 3D robotics vision, VR/AR tele-operation, parallel computing, and Cloud-Edge Robotics. During my PhD at UC Berkeley, I investigated how to build Cloud-Edge ”Hybrid” Robotic systems for dynamic physical human robot interactions (pHRIs). I have also built VR/AR interfaces for (1) tele-operation of robot arms, (2) an efficient text entry for mixed reality goggles(patent P1). In industry, I have successfully executed numerous robotics projects, as manager, lead scientist, principle
engineer, and principle investigator (see list of industry projects on page 2 & 3). I have built and managed research and development team, while continuously advising C-level executives on go-to-market strategies of Cloud-Edge Robotics for embodied AI (Cloudmind Inc.). Lastly, I have proposed, lead, and executed successful large scale industrial and government collaborations as the responsible PI (Siemens), while building strong partnership between the academics and industry (Bosch).
