High speed visual servo feeds back relative 3D pose between objects rather than absolute position.  The insertions are robust and precise even when either object slips or moves at any time.  A ["Blackbeard barrel insertion game"](https://www.robot-digest.com/newarticle/?id=1618191821-158917) made out of this work was later demonstrated in Manufacturing World, Nagoya, Japan, 2021.
