Safely control a dynamic robot arm, like you were playing a video game with the mixed reality digital double.  Reactive collision free motion planning were hosted from the Cloud. This work was also part of my talk at [ICRA 2024 Cloud Robotics Workshop, Yokohama, Japan](https://sites.google.com/view/icra-24-cloud-robotics/home).

<blockquote>
  <p>
Ever want to control a dynamic robot arm with just your hand without having to worry about it colliding with anything?  In this project, we leverage a reactive planner (MPPI) to perform dynamic collision free target reaching via a mixed reality teleopator interface (Hololens).  The operator can directly use their hand to guide the robot end-effector motion without having to worry about the robot arm's local surroundings.  Just like playing a game.

The best part is that the reactive motion controller and the teleoperation interface is hosted in the Cloud (Omniverse), and are connected to the robot via FogROS2.  This way, you can control the robot from anywhwere in the world, emersively, just like playing a video game, but on real robot.
